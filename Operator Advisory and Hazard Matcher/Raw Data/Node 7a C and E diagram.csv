1,"FT103, FT104, PT102, PT103, PT104, PDT105, LT101","0B,0C",Signal fault,"Check TT213, TT210, TT104 <50Â°C and PT103, PT104, PT115a, PT115b < 6 bar, if not anomalous. 
Send operator into plant to check indicator and surrounding indicators.
 If there is congruence between reading in control room and indicator on plant, take down signal protocol for the faulty transmitter. 
Call electrician. If there is no congruence between reading in control room and indicator on plant",10 seconds
2,"PT104, FT103, FT104","2B,1C,1C",Blockage in Z102 OR Blocked Line Downstream of SOV125,"Switch J100 control mode to manual and decrease J100 pump speed to 5%. Simultaneously monitor PT104. If it continues to spike, cut J100. 
Open V120. Then close V117a and V117b. 
Check SOV125, V402 and V403 are open
Monitor PT104. If PT104 is <2 bar, increase J100 speed sequentially in 5% steps to return to steady state operation",20 seconds
3,PDT105,"2B, 3A",Blockage/Slight Fouling in Z102,"Switch J100 control mode to manual and decrease J100 pump speed to 5%. Simultaneously monitor PT104. If it continues to spike, cut J100. Open V120. Then close V117a and V117b. Check SOV125, V402 and V403 are open. Monitor PT104. If PT104 is <2 bar, increase J100 speed sequentially in 5% steps to return to steady state operation",1-2 minutes
