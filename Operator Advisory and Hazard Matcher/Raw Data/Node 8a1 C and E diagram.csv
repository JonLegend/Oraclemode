1,"FT108, FT109, PT115a, PT115b, LT108","0B,0C",Signal fault,"Check TT213, TT210, TT104 <50Â°C and PT103, PT104, PT115a, PT115b < 6 bar, if not anomalous. Send operator into plant to check indicator and surrounding indicators. If there is congruence between reading in control room and indicator on plant, take down signal protocol for the faulty transmitter. Call electrician. If there is no congruence between reading in control room and indicator on plant.",10 seconds
2,"PT115a, FT108, FT109","2B,1C,1C",Blockage in Z102 OR Blocked Line Downstream of SOV125,"Switch J101a control mode to manual and decrease J101a pump speed to 5%. Simultaneously monitor PT115a. If it continues to spike, cut J101a.Open V212. Then close V211 and V213. Check V124, V119a, V119b are open (in flow direction for V119a and V119b). Monitor PT115a. If PT115a is <2 bar, increase J101a speed sequentially in 5% steps to return to steady state operation",20 seconds
3,"FT108, FT109, PT115a","0C, 0C, 2B",Blocked line between J101a and FT109,"Switch J101a control mode to manual and decrease J101a pump speed to 5%. Simultaneously monitor PT115a. If it continues to spike, cut J101a. Check V135a, V134a, V143a, V144a are open",1-2 minutes
4,LT108,1C/3C,Misdirected flow downstream of FT109,"Check SOV123, V150, V151, SOV152, V149, V153, V154, V210, V406, NRV400 and all absorber sample valves are closed and not visibly damaged. Check plant for visible MEA leakage",10-20 seconds
5,"LT108, FT108, FT109","1C/3C, 0C/1C,0C/1C",Misdirected flow upstream of FT109,"Check V139a, V142a, V146a, V147a, V133, V134b, V135b, V139b, V142b, V146b, V147b, V131, PCV120a, PCV120b, RV106a, RV106b and all absorber sample valves are closed and not visibly damaged. Check plant for visible MEA leakage",10-20 seconds
6,"FT108, FT109","1C,1C",Leak upstream of FT109,Check line for visible leaks. Attempt to locate the leak Refer to leak SOP.,3-4 minutes
7,"PT115a, FT108, FT109","3C,0C/3C,0C/3C",J101a Pump Malfunction (loss of power),"Shift J101a to manual control mode and decrease J101a speed in 5% steps down to zero. Check TT111a for pump overheat, and inspect J101a for damages",3-4 minutes
8,"PT115a, FT108, FT109","2B/3B,2B/3B,2B/3B",J101a Pump Controller / FIC 101a Malfunction (extreme oscillation),"Shift J101a to manual control mode and decrease J101a speed in 5% steps down. Monitor PT115a, FT108, FT109for continued anomalies. Adjust control parameters as required",3-4 minutes
